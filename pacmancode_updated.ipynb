    "I think we had difficulty starting just because we were inexperienced with pygame and we had a tough time deciding on what methods to do things such as draw the map and draw the sprites. Today though, we definitely got the hang of it. Ethan figured out a way a better way to load in the sprites and Peder created a program for the movement of the sprites. Ellysa is making progress on the map and Dante is finding the best sound track for the game. Once Ellysa has the map done, Javon will place pellets on the map and create a score board. I have made collision mechanics for 3 instances 1. pacman and border 2. pacman and sprites 3. pacman and pellets so I only have a single collision mechanic left: pacman and walls. That is a tad bit confusing for me just because I will also have to consider the direction pacman can move in(for example, if pacman can continue going up or if he has the liberty of moving left or right). I think I will use a series of if and elif/else statements to check what type of cell pacman is currently in and the type of cell is directly above, below, to the left, and to the right to see if any of them are the wall cell. Overall though,  We are making fantastic progress and we just need to nail down some of the basics mechanics and we will be all set."
